# Nginx Reverse Proxy Configuration
# This nginx acts as a proxy to another nginx service in docker swarm
# Pattern: Redirect example.com to www.example.com (both HTTP and HTTPS)

# HTTP: Redirect both example.com and www.example.com to HTTPS
server {
    listen [::]:80;
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com www.example.com;

    # Redirect to HTTPS www
    return 301 https://www.example.com$request_uri;
}

# HTTPS: Redirect example.com to www.example.com
server {
    listen [::]:443 ssl;
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name example.com;

    # SSL Certificate paths (must cover both example.com and www.example.com)
    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem;

    # Include common SSL configuration
    include /etc/nginx/conf.d/ssl-common.conf;

    # Redirect to www version
    return 301 https://www.example.com$request_uri;
}

# HTTPS: Main server block for www.example.com
server {
    listen [::]:443 ssl;
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name www.example.com;

    # SSL Certificate paths (must cover both example.com and www.example.com)
    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem;

    # Include common SSL configuration
    include /etc/nginx/conf.d/ssl-common.conf;

    # Proxy settings
    location / {
        # Replace 'backend-nginx' with your actual docker swarm service name
        proxy_pass http://backend-nginx:80;

        # Include common proxy configuration
        include /etc/nginx/conf.d/proxy-common.conf;
    }

    # Location for Let's Encrypt certificate renewal
    location /.well-known/acme-challenge {
        alias /usr/share/nginx/html/.well-known/acme-challenge;
        try_files $uri /index.html;
    }

    # Custom error pages (optional)
    error_page 502 503 504 /50x.html;
    location = /50x.html {
